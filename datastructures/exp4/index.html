          This experiment guides you using Linked lists in a practical example. This is useful if you want to understand linked lists or if you want to see a realistic, applied example of pointer-intensive code. In this experiment, you will essentially use linked lists to add and multiply (sparse) polynomials.

          <big>The Array Data Structure</big>
          <br>
          In this framework, we now see the array as a data structure. The typical operations on this data structure are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li> to create an array data structure, called create(name, size)</li>
            <li> to access the element at a given index i, called ElementAt(index, name)</li>
            <li> to find the size of the array, called size(name)</li>
            <li> to print the contents of the array, called print(name)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          While we are used to writing A[i] to access element i of an array A, it can be seen as the way to access the ith element in a non-object oriented programming language. The other operations are also not explicity specified when one uses languages such as C. But, when one considers purely object oriented languages, such operations are required to be supported. Similarly, in C, array creation is done by malloc() or a compile time declaration as int A[10];. However, when one looks at a data structure in terms of its operations, a create() operation is required.
        </p>
        <p>
          <big>The Linked List Data Structure</big>
          <br>
          Linked lists are useful to study for two reasons. Most obviously, linked lists are a data structure which you may want to use in real programs. Seeing the strengths and weaknesses of linked lists will give you an appreciation of the some of the time, space, and code issues which are useful to thinking about any data structures in general.Somewhat less obviously, linked lists are great way to learn about pointers. In fact, you may never use a linked list in a real program, but you are certain to use lots of pointers. Linked list problems are a nice combination of algorithms and pointer manipulation. Traditionally, linked lists have been the domain where beginning programmers get the practice to really understand pointers.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <big>Application of linked lists is to polynomials</big>
          We now use linked lists to perform operations on polynomials. Let f(x) = Î£di=0 aixi. The quantity d is called as the degree of the polynomial, with the assumption that ad not equal to 0. A polynomial of degree d may however have missing terms i.e., powers j such that 0 <= j < d and aj = 0.The standard operations on a polynomial are addition and multiplication. If we store the coefficient ofeach term of the polynomials in an array of size d + 1, then these operations can be supported in a straightforwardway. However, for sparse polynomails, i.e., polynomials where there are few non-zero coefficients,this is not efficient. One possible solution is to use linked lists to store degree, coefficient pairs for non-zero coefficients.With this representation, it makes it easier if we keep the list of such pairs in decreasing order of degrees.

            if(<i>test expression</i>)
            {
                    block1;
            }
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, if the <i>test expression</i> is true, then statements in <i>block1</i> are executed. If the <i>test expression</i> is false then statements in <i>block1</i> are completly ignored.
          <p>
            <big>If-Else construct</big><br>
            This construct is used to execute one out of two blocks of statements based on the truthvalue of a conditon. The syntax of an If-else statement is as follows:
           </p> 
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            if(<i>test expression</i>)
            {
                    block1;
            }
            else
            {
                    block2;
            }
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, if the <i>test expression</i> is true, then statements in <i>block1</i> are executed. If the <i>test expression</i> is false then statements in <i>block2</i> are executed.<br><br>
          <big> Nesting example</big><br>
          If and If-else statements can be nested to create more complex control flows:
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            if(<i>test expression1</i>){ 
                    statements1; 
                    if(<i>test expression2</i>){ 
                            statements2; 
                    } 
            } 
            else{ 
                    statements3; 
                    if(<i>test expression3</i>){ 
                            statements4; 
                    } 
                    else{ 
                            statements5; 
                    } 
            } 
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here if the <i>test expression1</i> is true then <i>statements1</i> are executed followed by the evaluation of <i>test expression2</i>. If <i>test expression2</i> is true, <i>statements2</i> are executed; if it is false, then <i>statements2</i> are completly ignored.<br>
           If <i>test expression1</i> is false, then <i>statements3</i> are executed followed by evalution of <i>test expression3</i>. If <i>test expression3</i> is true <i>statements4</i> are executed. If <i>test expression3</i> is false then <i>statements5</i> are executed.
          <br><br>
          <big>If-Else ladder</big>
          <br>
          When a series mutually exclusive conditions(for example, deciding grade based on marks) have to be checked, then we may use the If-else ladder construct. This construct is essentially created by repeatedly nesting an if-else construct inside the else part of an If-else construct. The conditions are evaluated from top to bottom and whenever a condition is true, then the statements corresponding to the true part of the condition are executed and we exit out of the construct. The final else part is executed only if all the conditions get evaluated to false. It takes the following general form:
          <br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            if (<i>test expression1</i>) 
               statements1; 
            else if (<i>test expression2</i>) 
               statements2; 
            else if (<i>test expression3</i>) 
               statements3; 
            else if (<i>test expression4</i>) 
               statements4; 
            else 
               statements5; 
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, the <i>test expression1</i> is evaluated first and if it is true then the <i>statements1</i> are executed and we exit out of the construct. If <i>test expression1</i> is false, then <i>test expression2</i> is evaluated. If <i>test expression2</i> is true then <i>statements2</i> are executed and we exit out of the construct.  If <i>test expression2</i> is false, then <i>test expression3</i> is evaluated. If <i>test expression3</i> is true then <i>statements3</i> are executed and we exit out of the construct.  If <i>test expression3</i> is false, then <i>test expression4</i> is evaluated. If <i>test expression4</i> is true then <i>statements4</i> are executed and we exit out of the construct.  If <i>test expression4</i> is false, then <i>statements4</i> are executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <big>Switch-Case constructs</big><br>
          A Switch-Case is a construct which is used to allow jumping to one of the multiple blocks. This decision is taken based on the value of a variable or an expression. Its purpose is to allow the value of a variable or an expression to control the flow of program execution via a multiway branch. A default case may also be specified to be executed when the given state has not been addressed by any of the other cases. 
          <br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            switch ( <i>test expression</i> ) { 
              case 1 :  
                statement1;  
              break;   
              case 2 :  
                statement2;  
              break;  
              case n :  //an example general case
                statementn;  
              break;   
              default : 
                statements_default; 
            } 
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, if <i>test expression</i> evaluates to 1, then <i>statements1</i> are evaluated. And then due to <i>break</i>, we exit the construct. 
          If <i>test expression</i> evaluates to 2, then <i>statements1</i> are evaluated. And then due to <i>break</i>, we exit the construct. 
          Similarly, if <i>test expression</i> evaluates to some value n for which a case has been written under <i>case n:</i>, then <i>statementsn</i> are evaluated. And then due to <i>break</i>, we exit the construct.
          If <i>test expression</i> evalutes to a value for which a case has not been listed, then <i>statements_default</i> are executed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><i>Important: </i></b><br>
          1. Take special note of the difference between the relational operator "equal to" which is denoted by "==", and the assignement operator which is denoted by "=".  Misuse of "=" in the place of "==" won't be reported by the compiler. <br>
          For example:<br>
          Writing,
          <pre class= "prettyprint">
            if(x=3){
            statements1;
            }
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          instead of
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            if(x==3){
            statements1;
            }
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          will result into the test expression for the if construct to always be true and hence, <i>statements1</i> are always executed.
          <br>
          2. Typically, the last statement for each case is a break statement. This causes program execution to jump to the statement following the closing bracket of the switch statement, which is what one would normally want to happen. However if the break statement is omitted, program execution continues with the first line of the next case, if any. This is called a fall-through.<br>
